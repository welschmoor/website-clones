        An ever growing collection<br /> featuring some of the best<br /> scenes in horror.
      </h2>
      <p class="mainparaf">“Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the most affecting in
        horror. Some may be
        simple black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't necessarily
        “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.</p>

      <p class="lastparaf">Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon Durham. Most film
        clips contain major
        spoilers, and it is recommended you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.</p>

        When I discover a film I feel is really special in some way, I usually drag as many people to the theater as
        possible to see it with me before it’s banished to the streaming realm forever. I’m always excited by the
        challenge of choosing people I’m sure will enjoy it as much as I do, but I’m not always right.

        With Under the Skin (2013), I had about a 50% success rate with people either really loving it or really hating
        it. With Let the Right One In (2008), I hit a near 100% success rate with the only complaint being having to
        read subtitles (which is clearly not a complaint about the movie and says more about the viewer). With Blue Ruin
        I hit my first home run (did I use that sportsball metaphor correctly?). Now, I’ve only shared it with about 4–5
        people, but across the board everyone really loved the movie.

        Director Jeremy Saulnier needs to write the handbook for making great films on a small budget. The budget for
        this film was around $420,000, which is just remarkable. I’ve never made a film, but this just seems like an
        impossible challenge. I’d love to know how they pulled it off. I’m so glad they did.
